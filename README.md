simulate_RU_link
================

Application that simulates a RU link using [KDL](www.orocos.org/kdl).
The user inteface is done using Qt and the 3D viewer using [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/).

This application was developed for a rapid prototype request, so only 24 hours were spent during a 5 day raw.
